        <h2>When I'm not helping teams be more productive while maintaining a healthy work-life balance, I'm doing the following things.</h2>
        <section class="activity">
            <h3>Home Life</h3> <!--maybe home life, dogs, or life history-->
            <aside><image src="https://fresharts.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/150-1-scaled.jpg" alt="photo of houston skyline and graffiti tag saying Be Someone" class="activity-img"></image></aside>
            <p>Although originally from the Rio Grande Valley, I have been in Houston, TX for the last decade. I like to go out with my friends and experience everything this metropolis has to offer us.  The flavors of Houston have inspired me to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. While I love cooking all kinds of food, I am always trying to perfect the regional Mexican food of my hometown of McAllen, TX.  Currently signature dish at the moment is green chile enchiladas from scratch.</p>

            <h3>Recreation</h3>

            <p>Whenever I have some time to myself you can find me either voraciously consuming media from my library or cooking in the kitchen. I have a large collection of Stephen King and other classic horror novels. I usually have a goal of 25-30 books read by the end of the year. I love watching movies at the theater; I go several times a month.  My passion for these stories has inspired me to work towards creating stories and experiences of mine that have teeth so deep they won't let go of you.</p>

            <p>For the last several months I have been playing Dungeons and Dragons virtually with friends and family across the country. I am playing the part of Game Master, which takes an embarrassing amount of hours towards prep time before the other players even show up for each event! Despite my work ahead of time, the collaborative nature of the game often takes the story in directions I could never have expected. I use my skills as a web developer on a weekly basis to flesh out a living document that details everything my players should know about the game in its current state including access to character files, journals, maps, handouts, and much more. </p>
