                <p>Although originally from the Rio Grande Valley, I have been in Houston, TX for the last decade. I like to go out with my friends and experience everything this metropolis has to offer us.  The flavors of Houston have inspired me to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. While I love cooking all kinds of food, I am always trying to perfect the regional Mexican food of my hometown of McAllen, TX.  Currently my signature dish is homemade green chile enchiladas. </p>

                <p>Whenever I have some time to myself you can find me voraciously consuming media from my library. I have a large collection of Stephen King and other classic horror novels. I usually have a goal of 25-30 books read by the end of the year. I love watching movies at the theater; I go several times a month.  My passion for these stories has inspired me to work towards creating stories and experiences of mine that have teeth so deep they won't let go of you.</p>

                <p>For the last several months I have been acting as a Game Master in a virutal game of Dungeons and Dragons with friends and family across the country. Despite my work ahead of time, the collaborative nature of the game often takes the story in directions I could never have expected. Although I am using Google Sheets for now, I intend to use my skills as a web developer to continue my work creating an accesible guide for my players.</p>
